# Website Style Guide: 

Welcome to the Website Style Guide project! In this project, I have developed a comprehensive style guide and design system for a fictional website named "." A design system is a valuable tool used to organize and maintain the visual elements and components of a website, ensuring a consistent and cohesive user experience.

## Project Overview

The Website Style Guide serves as a centralized resource to document the key design aspects of the website, including colors, typography, and specific text styles. By creating this design system, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

- Organize the Look and Feel: Present a clear and organized visual vocabulary for the website's design elements.

- Maintain Consistency: Ensure that the website's visual elements remain consistent across various pages and components.

- Enhance Collaboration: Facilitate collaboration among developers by providing a consistent reference for designing and building the website.

## Features

The Website Style Guide consists of the following sections:

- **Colors:** Explore the primary color palette of the website, including shades of blue, pink, and green. Each color is represented with its corresponding hex code.

- **Typography:** Discover the fonts used on the website, including Greycliff CF, Playfair Display, and Roboto Mono. Each font style (normal, italic, and bold) is showcased with sample text.

- **Styling:** Understand the specific styles applied to various text elements, including headings (h1, h2, h3). Detailed CSS rules for font family, font style, font size, font weight, letter spacing, word spacing, text color, and text transformations are provided.
