# websitestylingLP
CodeAcademy Project

In this project, I have built a style guide/design system for a website. This is to organize the look and feel of a website or web application. 
Design systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website. As websites grow larger and more complex, having 
a consistent set of styles helps them stay cohesive and enjoyable for users! It also helps as one start working with other developers, as you can 
have a consistent reference for how your website should be built.

My style guide/design system includes a section on colors, fonts, and specific text styles.
